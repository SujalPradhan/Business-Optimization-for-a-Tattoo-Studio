### Executive Summary
[cite_start]This project presents a detailed analysis of data from **Ink Over Matter**, a tattoo studio in Kodahalli, Bangalore, which has been operating since 2012[cite: 525, 884, 1067]. [cite_start]The primary goal was to address business challenges such as a lack of digital presence, limited marketing, operational scalability issues, and reliance on a single revenue stream[cite: 525, 884, 1068, 1070].

[cite_start]The analysis used a dataset from 2018 to early 2024[cite: 526, 885]. Key findings revealed:
* [cite_start]**Temporal Trends:** The studio experienced consistent appointment bookings and income before 2020, suffered a significant loss due to COVID-19 in 2020, and showed a strong recovery from 2022 to 2024, with 2023 being the most prosperous year[cite: 13, 14, 400, 404, 407, 409]. [cite_start]Peak revenue months are typically January, March, and July[cite: 16, 894].
* [cite_start]**Customer Demographics:** The 18-25 age group constitutes the largest client base, but the **26-30 age group** generates the highest average revenue per appointment[cite: 23, 25, 528].
* [cite_start]**Tattoo Preferences:** Revenue is highest from intricate, full-body tattoos like sleeves and back tattoos[cite: 528, 581, 582].
* [cite_start]**Customer Loyalty:** Repeat customers are highly loyal, generating over 80% of the studio's revenue with a revisit rate of 82.6%[cite: 529].
* [cite_start]**Geographic Reach:** The studio's clients and revenue are primarily concentrated in South Indian states, particularly **Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu**[cite: 18, 532, 895].

### Analysis Procedure
[cite_start]The analysis was conducted using Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn[cite: 527, 527, 887]. [cite_start]The raw data was cleaned and pre-processed to normalize categorical fields, parse dates, and convert string values to binary[cite: 63, 65, 68, 811, 812, 814, 815].

The following key analyses were performed:
* [cite_start]**Monthly Appointment Count per Year:** To identify seasonal and yearly trends in appointment bookings[cite: 543, 546].
* [cite_start]**Revisit Percentage:** To measure client retention and loyalty[cite: 556, 557].
* [cite_start]**Average Revenue per Age Group and Tattoo Type:** To identify which customer segments and services generate the most revenue[cite: 571, 572, 579, 581].
* [cite_start]**Tattoo Type Preference by Gender:** To understand how preferences vary and to aid in personalized marketing[cite: 588, 590].
* [cite_start]**State-wise Revenue Contribution:** To understand the geographic spread of clients and revenue[cite: 604, 606].
