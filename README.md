Driving Growth Through Enhanced Revenue, Reach, and Operational Efficiency

---

### Executive Summary
This project presents a detailed analysis of data from **Ink Over Matter**, a tattoo studio in Kodahalli, Bangalore, which has been operating since 2012. The primary goal was to address business challenges such as a lack of digital presence, limited marketing, operational scalability issues, and reliance on a single revenue stream.

The analysis used a dataset from 2018 to early 2024. Key findings revealed:
* **Temporal Trends:** The studio experienced consistent appointment bookings and income before 2020, suffered a significant loss due to COVID-19 in 2020, and showed a strong recovery from 2022 to 2024, with 2023 being the most prosperous year. Peak revenue months are typically January, March, and July.
* **Customer Demographics:** The 18-25 age group constitutes the largest client base, but the **26-30 age group** generates the highest average revenue per appointment.
* **Tattoo Preferences:** Revenue is highest from intricate, full-body tattoos like sleeves and back tattoos.
* **Customer Loyalty:** Repeat customers are highly loyal, generating over 80% of the studio's revenue with a revisit rate of 82.6%.
* **Geographic Reach:** The studio's clients and revenue are primarily concentrated in South Indian states, particularly **Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu**.

* **Revisit Percentage:** To measure client retention and loyalty.
* **Average Revenue per Age Group and Tattoo Type:** To identify which customer segments and services generate the most revenue.

* **Regional Marketing:** Focus on the core markets of Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu by using local language ads or collaborating with regional influencers.

#### Revenue and Operational Efficiency
* **Promote High-Value Tattoos:** Highlight intricate and large tattoos on social media since they generate the most revenue.
* **Diversify Revenue Streams:** Introduce additional products like tattoo aftercare kits or branded merchandise to reduce dependence on a single income source.
